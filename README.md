# person-with-a-username

I am, as my name suggests, a person with a username.

Pronouns: he/him.

Some stuff about me:

- I am interested in functional programming and proof assistants.

  - Proof assistants also caused me to be interested in constructive math.

- I'm also occasionally interested in esoteric languages, since they have this nice Rube Goldberg-like feel.

- I'm a bit new to GitHub and Git and stuff (not really, but I'm just not very good at using them).
