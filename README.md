# person-with-a-username

I am, as my name suggests, a person with a username. I go by #9095 on Discord, and my pronouns are he/him.

Some stuff about me:

- I program mainly in Python, but I wish I knew some functional programming languages.

- I'm a bit new to GitHub and Git and stuff (not really, but I'm just not very good at using them).

- There are literally (I mean this in the literal sense) no other facts about me.
